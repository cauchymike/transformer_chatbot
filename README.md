# PyTorch Implementation of a Chatbot using Transformers and Universal Transformers

This is an experiment on using Transformers to build a Chatbot (Question-Answer System). The code is heavily commented and is more like a tutorial. 

This gives us an indepth understanding of how embeddings work and how we can create better vectors to get better results

## Requirements 
PyTorch 1.1.0 or higher, Python 3.6/3.7

## Dataset
Download the Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus from [here](https://zissou.infosci.cornell.edu/convokit/datasets/movie-corpus/) and unzip the file to your directory

## Files
`preprocess.py:` Dataset Preproceesing <br/>
`utils.py:` Utilities  <br/>
`models.py:` Transformer Models <br/>
`train.py:` Training Script <br/>
`chat.py:` Evaluation/Chatting Script
